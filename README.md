# Love Ledger

Welcome to the Love Ledger project! üíö

## What is Love Ledger?

Love Ledger is a community-driven platform for recognizing, tracking, and rewarding care, ecological stewardship, and meaningful contributions to our communities. It serves as the technical foundation for the **Hearts** and **Leaves** currency systems described in the [Global Governance Frameworks](https://globalgovernanceframeworks.org).

### Core Concepts

- **Hearts** (üíö): Recognition for care work, community support, cultural preservation, and social contributions
- **Leaves** (üçÉ): Recognition for ecological restoration, environmental stewardship, and planetary health activities  
- **Love Ledger**: The distributed system that tracks and validates these contributions while protecting community autonomy

## Framework Integration

This project implements key components from several interconnected frameworks:

- **[Work in Liberation Framework](https://globalgovernanceframeworks.org/frameworks/work-in-liberation)** - Organizing meaningful work and Community Work Teams
- **[Financial Systems Framework](https://globalgovernanceframeworks.org/frameworks/financial-systems)** - Hearts/Leaves currency mechanics and the Love Ledger system
- **[AUBI Framework](https://globalgovernanceframeworks.org/frameworks/aubi)** - Adaptive Universal Basic Income integration with contribution bonuses
- **[Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance](https://globalgovernanceframeworks.org/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge)** - Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs) and traditional stewardship principles

## Project Status

üöß **Early Development Phase** üöß

This repository is in the initial planning and design phase. We're building Love Ledger as a practical implementation of the theoretical frameworks developed by the Global Governance Frameworks project.

### What's Available Now

- **Framework Documentation**: Complete specifications available at [globalgovernanceframeworks.org](https://globalgovernanceframeworks.org)
- **Source Repository**: Framework documents and website code at [github.com/GlobalGovernanceFrameworks/website](https://github.com/GlobalGovernanceFrameworks/website)
- **Implementation Plans**: Detailed technical and governance mechanics in the framework appendices

### What's Coming

- Community-controlled validation protocols
- Multi-modal access (web, mobile, SMS, offline)
- Indigenous data sovereignty protections  
- Integration with Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs)
- Proof of Care verification systems
- Inter-currency translation capabilities

## Key Principles

- **Community Sovereignty**: Communities control their own data and participation
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Respects Indigenous protocols and diverse governance traditions
- **Accessibility**: Works across different technology access levels
- **Privacy-First**: User-controlled data sharing with strong encryption
- **Regenerative Economics**: Rewards care and ecological stewardship over extraction

*"Every act of care counts, every Heart is currency, and every gift is wealth."*

**Note**: This is an active project in early development. The frameworks provide the theoretical foundation, and this repository will evolve into the practical implementation. We welcome community input and collaboration while maintaining strong commitments to justice, sovereignty, and regenerative principles.
