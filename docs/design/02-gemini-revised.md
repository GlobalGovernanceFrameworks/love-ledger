I am **100% onboard** with Claude's revision.

This is the voice of the "Senior Engineer" pulling the "Visionary Architect" back down to earth. Claude is absolutely right: **We are building infrastructure, not a video game.**

If this app drains the battery of an 80-year-old lady on a freezing bus in Norrtälje because we wanted "AR particles," we have failed.

### 🛠️ The Revised "Brutally Minimal" MVP Strategy

Here is how we adapt our "Hearth" concept to Claude’s constraints while keeping the soul of the project.

#### 1. The "Fireplace" Pivot (Activity vs. Balance)

Claude’s critique that "burning a balance feels bad" is genius.

* **New Concept:** The Fire represents **Connection Velocity**.
* *High Activity (Sending/Receiving):* The icon glows warm/bright. "Your community connection is strong."
* *Low Activity:* It’s a dim ember. "Time to reach out to someone?"


* **The Balance:** Just a number (hidden by default, click to reveal).
* *Why this is better:* It nudges people to **circulate** the love, not hoard it.

#### 2. The Color Palette (Warning vs. Warmth)

Claude is right about Amber = Warning in Sweden (Check Engine Light).

* **Adopted Color:** **Terracotta / Faluröd (Falu Red).**
* Nothing says "Swedish Home" like Falu Red. It is warm, earthy, and culturally deep. It feels like a *Stuga*, not an error message.



#### 3. The "Swish-ification" of the Interface

We drop the "Slide to Send" and "AR Camera."

* **The Standard:** We copy **Swish** almost exactly.
* *Why:* Every Swede from 7 to 97 knows how to use Swish. It is muscle memory. We piggyback on that trust.


* **The Twist:** The *only* difference is the "Hidden Amount" mechanic. That is our one innovation. Everything else is standard.

#### 4. Accessibility First (DOS-lagen)

This is the "Kill Shot" for winning the government grants.

* **High Contrast Mode:** We don't just add it; we make it the **Crisis Mode**.
* *Peace Time:* Soft whites, Falu Red, Sage Green. (Standard contrast).
* *Crisis Mode:* Pure Black background, Yellow text, White borders. (Hyper-legible, low battery usage).

### 🧱 The "Paper Prototype" (Your January Hobby Task)

Since you want to start in January, forget coding Rust for a moment. **Let's design the screens.**

We need to visualize this "Ugly Duckling."

**Screen 1: The Feed (Home)**

* **Top Bar:**
* Left: A small "Ember/Fire" icon (Status).
* Right: "Crisis Toggle" (Switch).


* **Main Area:** A vertical list of "Cards" (Transactions).
* *Visual:* [Avatar] --- [Heart Icon] --- [Avatar]
* *Text:* "Björn sent warmth to Sven."
* *Interaction:* Click card -> Expands to show message ("Thanks for the tires!") and amount (+50).



**Screen 2: The Action (Send)**

* **Trigger:** Big Floating Action Button (FAB) at bottom right. (Standard Android).
* **Flow:** Select Contact -> Select Amount (Chips: 25, 50, 100) -> Add Message -> **Send**.
* *No sliding, no particles. Just "Sent".*

**Screen 3: The Profile (Me)**

* **Background:** Clean white/grey.
* **Badges:** Instead of a complex forest, just a row of simple icons.
* 🌱 (10 Leaves)
* 🌲 (100 Leaves)


* **Balance:** A blurred text field `****`. Click to see `450 Hearts`.

### 🔮 Visualizing the MVP

To make this concrete, I can generate a prompt for an image generator (like Midjourney) or just describe it precisely so you can sketch it.

**Shall we try to visualize this "Falu Red / Minimalist" aesthetic with the "Crisis Mode" toggle?**
