# Love Ledger üíö

Welcome to the Love Ledger project!

## What is Love Ledger?

Love Ledger is a community-driven platform for recognizing, tracking, and rewarding care, ecological stewardship, and meaningful contributions to our communities. It serves as the technical foundation for the **Hearts** (üíö) and **Leaves** (üçÉ) currency systems described in the [Global Governance Frameworks](https://globalgovernanceframeworks.org).

### Core Concepts

  - **Hearts** (üíö): Recognition for care work, community support, cultural preservation, and social contributions.
  - **Leaves** (üçÉ): Recognition for ecological restoration, environmental stewardship, and planetary health activities.
  - **Love Ledger**: The distributed system that tracks and validates these contributions while protecting community autonomy.

## Framework Integration

This project implements key components from several interconnected frameworks:

  - **[Work in Liberation Framework](https://globalgovernanceframeworks.org/frameworks/work-in-liberation)** - Organizing meaningful work and Community Work Teams.
  - **[Financial Systems Framework](https://globalgovernanceframeworks.org/frameworks/financial-systems)** - Hearts/Leaves currency mechanics and the Love Ledger system.
  - **[AUBI Framework](https://globalgovernanceframeworks.org/frameworks/aubi)** - Adaptive Universal Basic Income integration with contribution bonuses.
  - **[Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance](https://globalgovernanceframeworks.org/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge)** - Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs) and traditional stewardship principles.

## Project Status

üöß **Active Development: Building the MVP Web App** üöß

The theoretical frameworks and core data schemas (`ggf-core`) are complete. Our current focus is on building the official web application as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to enable our first community pilot. The backend logic for the care economy engine is well-defined, and this repository contains the code for its tangible implementation.

## The Web Application

This repository contains the official web application for the Love Ledger. It is a modern, full-stack application built to be accessible, secure, and culturally sensitive.

### Tech Stack

  * **Framework**: SvelteKit
  * **Language**: TypeScript
  * **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
  * **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM (using SQLite for local dev, PostgreSQL for production)
  * **Testing**: Vitest (Unit/Component) & Playwright (End-to-End)
  * **Authentication**: Lucia (for MVP, with a roadmap to DID/UCAN integration)

### Key MVP Features

The initial version of the web app will focus on three core user journeys:

1.  **üìù Log Care Acts**: A simple, accessible form for community members to submit their contributions for validation.
2.  **‚úÖ Community Validation**: A secure interface for designated Community Weavers to review and validate submissions based on community-defined protocols.
3.  **üìä User Dashboard**: A personal dashboard for users to track their üíö **Hearts** and üçÉ **Leaves** balances and view their contribution history.

## üöÄ Getting Started (Local Development)

Interested in running the app locally or contributing? Follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites:**

      * Node.js (v18 or higher)
      * npm

2.  **Installation:**

    ```bash
    # Clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/GlobalGovernanceFrameworks/love-ledger.git

    # Navigate to the project directory
    cd love-ledger

    # Install dependencies
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Environment Setup:**

    ```bash
    # Copy the example environment file
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    *You'll need to fill in the variables in the `.env` file as instructed within it.*

4.  **Run the Development Server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173`.
