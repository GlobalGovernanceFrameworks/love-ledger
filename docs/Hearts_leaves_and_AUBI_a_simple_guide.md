# Hearts, Leaves & AUBI: A Simple Guide
## What This Is and How It Works

*Last Updated: December 21, 2025*

## The Problem We're Solving

**Have you ever noticed that...**

- The most important work in society—caring for children, helping elderly neighbors, preserving culture, restoring nature—pays nothing or almost nothing?
- You could be working full-time and still struggling to afford rent and groceries?
- The things that make life meaningful (time with family, helping friends, creative projects, volunteering) get squeezed out by the need to "make money"?
- When financial crises hit, people who've been working their whole lives can suddenly lose everything?

**What if there was a different way?**

Imagine a system where:
- Everyone has enough to live on, no matter what
- Taking care of others is recognized as valuable work
- Planting trees and restoring rivers actually pays you
- Your community has its own money that keeps working even when banks freeze
- The harder you work for your community, the more everyone benefits

That's what Hearts, Leaves, and AUBI are designed to do.

## The Big Picture: How It All Fits Together

Think of it like this:

**AUBI (Adaptive Universal Basic Income)** = *Your safety net*
- Every month, you get a baseline amount to cover your basic needs
- No strings attached, no forms to fill out, no proving you "deserve" it
- Part cash, part Hearts (explained below)

**Hearts (💚)** = *Recognition for care work*
- A digital currency your community uses to pay for care, culture, and social contributions
- Earned when you help others, teach skills, preserve culture, organize events
- Spent at local Community Providers for services you need

**Leaves (🍃)** = *Proof of ecological work*
- Special tokens (like certificates) for verified environmental restoration
- Earned when you plant forests, clean rivers, restore wetlands, protect wildlife
- Permanent record of your contribution to healing the planet

**Work in Liberation** = *How work is organized*
- Replaces the "get a job or starve" model
- Teams of people offering services the community needs
- Paid in Hearts, governed by the community, focused on meaningful contribution

**Love Ledger** = *The gratitude system*
- Non-monetary recognition for everything that shouldn't be bought and sold
- Spontaneous help, friendship, mentoring, cultural sharing
- Builds trust and connection without putting a price on kindness

## How It Works: A Day in Your Life (2027)

Let's say you live in Stockholm and your community has adopted this system. Here's how a typical month might look:

### **Week 1: You Receive Your AUBI**

On the 1st of the month, you automatically receive:
- **8,400 SEK** (about $840 USD) in regular money to your bank account
- **360 Hearts (💚)** to your Hearts wallet on your phone

This happens every month. No application, no interview, no proving you're "worthy." It's yours because you're part of the community.

**What this covers**: Rent, food, utilities, transportation, basic healthcare. Not luxurious, but enough to live with dignity.

### **Week 2: You Decide How to Contribute**

You don't *have* to work to get your AUBI, but you probably *want* to contribute something meaningful. You open the Community Work app and see local opportunities:

**Option A: Join a Care Team**
- Eldercare team needs someone to help seniors with grocery shopping and companionship
- 10 hours/week
- Pays 50 Hearts per hour = 500 Hearts/week extra

**Option B: Join an Ecological Restoration Team**
- Wetland restoration project in the archipelago
- 15 hours/week
- Pays 40 Hearts per hour + earns Leaves for verified ecological impact

**Option C: Teach a Skill**
- You're good at carpentry—teach a weekly woodworking class
- 5 hours/week
- Pays 60 Hearts per hour (teaching valued highly)

You choose Option B because you love being outdoors and want to help restore nature.

### **Week 3: You Do Meaningful Work**

**Monday-Friday mornings**: You work with your restoration team, planting native species, removing invasive plants, and monitoring water quality.

**What happens**:
1. Each day's work is logged in the Community Work app
2. Photos and GPS data are automatically recorded
3. At the end of the week, a Community Weaver (like a quality inspector, but focused on community value) validates your work
4. You earn 600 Hearts (15 hours × 40 Hearts/hour)
5. You also earn 10 Leaves (🍃) because your work had verified ecological impact

**The Leaves are special**: They're like permanent certificates that say "I helped restore this specific wetland." You can show them to your grandkids someday. They also give you a say in how that restored land is managed.

### **Week 4: You Spend Your Hearts**

Now you have:
- **Regular money** from your AUBI for normal bills
- **960 Hearts** (360 baseline + 600 earned)

What can you spend Hearts on?

**Community Providers accept Hearts**:
- **Local childcare co-op**: 200 Hearts/week for after-school care
- **Community kitchen**: 50 Hearts for a week's worth of prepared meals
- **Bike repair shop**: 100 Hearts for a tune-up
- **Tutoring service**: 150 Hearts for your kid's math help
- **Community garden**: 30 Hearts for a season's worth of fresh vegetables

You decide to:
- Pay 200 Hearts for childcare
- Pay 50 Hearts for prepared meals (you were too busy with restoration work to cook)
- Save 710 Hearts for next month

**Here's the interesting part**: Your Hearts slowly lose value if you just hoard them (about 0.5% per month). This encourages you to spend them and keep the community economy flowing. Think of Hearts like fresh food—best used while they're "fresh."

## The Love Ledger: The Things Money Shouldn't Buy

Not everything should be transactional. Some things are sacred.

**Same month, different story**:

- Your neighbor's car broke down, you gave them a ride to work for a week
- You helped a friend move apartments on Saturday
- You showed up to a community meeting and contributed good ideas
- You mentored a teenager who was struggling

None of this earns Hearts. Instead, it's logged in the **Love Ledger**:
- Your friend gives you a "Gratitude Token" (like a digital thank-you)
- The teenager's parent gives you one
- Your neighbor gives you one

These don't turn into money. They can't be sold. But they:
- Build your reputation in the community
- Show up on your "Love, Meaning, and Connection Score" (LMCI)
- Help you feel seen and appreciated
- Matter when you're asking to join a Community Work Team

**Why separate these?** Because we don't want friendship to become transactional. Helping a friend shouldn't be "I'll do this if you pay me." The Love Ledger recognizes it without corrupting it.

## Common Questions

### **"Isn't this just welfare?"**

No, for three big reasons:

1. **AUBI is universal**: Everyone gets it—the millionaire and the struggling student. No means testing, no shame, no bureaucracy.

2. **You can earn more**: Unlike welfare that often cuts off when you start working, AUBI is your floor. Contribute more, earn more Hearts. There's no penalty for doing well.

3. **It recognizes non-market value**: Welfare says "we'll give you money until you get a real job." AUBI says "caring for your elderly parent IS real work, and here are Hearts to prove it."

### **"Where does the money come from?"**

Multiple sources:

1. **Automation Tax**: When companies replace human workers with robots/AI, they pay a percentage of the productivity gain. (If a robot does the work of 10 people, the company pays tax on that.)

2. **Resource Taxes**: Companies extracting natural resources (mining, oil, logging) pay for what they take from the commons.

3. **Commons Dividends**: Revenue from shared resources (like Norway's oil fund, but broader).

4. **The Hearts Treasury**: A community-managed fund that backs Hearts with real money, so you can always exchange them if needed.

### **"Won't people just be lazy?"**

The data says no. Here's why:

1. **Most people want meaningful work**: They just don't want exploitative jobs. When you remove the "work or starve" fear, people choose work that matters to them.

2. **AUBI is modest**: It covers basics, not luxuries. Most people want more than basics.

3. **Social recognition**: The Love Ledger and Hearts system mean your contributions are visible and valued. People want that.

4. **Real-world tests**: Every basic income pilot ever run shows people don't stop working. They:
   - Choose better jobs (less exploitation)
   - Go back to school
   - Start businesses
   - Do more volunteer work
   - Spend more time with family

### **"What about inflation? Won't prices just go up?"**

Several built-in safeguards:

1. **Hearts have demurrage**: They slowly lose value if hoarded, so there's pressure to spend them (circulation) but not panic-spend them (inflation).

2. **Dual currency**: You get both regular money and Hearts. Regular money for normal economy, Hearts for care economy. They don't compete.

3. **Community Providers set prices**: Local governance, not profit-maximizing corporations. A childcare co-op has different incentives than a private equity-owned chain.

4. **The Hearts Treasury**: Manages supply to prevent too many Hearts chasing too few services.

### **"How is this different from cryptocurrency?"**

Good question! Key differences:

**Cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin)**:
- Designed for speculation (buy low, sell high)
- Energy-intensive mining
- Works best when people hoard it
- No connection to real-world value
- Controlled by whoever has the most computing power

**Hearts**:
- Designed for circulation (use it or lose it)
- Minimal energy use (Holochain, not blockchain mining)
- Works best when people spend it on community services
- Directly tied to verified care and ecological work
- Controlled by community governance (elected councils, not miners)

**Both are digital currencies, but Hearts is designed to serve communities, not speculators.**

### **"What if I move to another city?"**

Your AUBI travels with you. Your Love Ledger score is portable (like a LinkedIn profile but for community contribution). 

Hearts are local to your Bioregional Autonomous Zone (BAZ), so when you move:
- Spend your Hearts before you leave, or
- Convert them to regular money at the Hearts Treasury (small fee)
- In your new community, you'll start earning that region's Hearts

Think of it like traveling between countries with different currencies, but simpler.

### **"Can I get fired from a Community Work Team?"**

Yes, but the process is different from corporate employment:

**Why you might be asked to leave**:
- Not showing up consistently without communication
- Treating others disrespectfully
- Doing genuinely bad work despite training and support

**The process**:
1. Community Weaver talks to you to understand what's happening
2. Team offers support or training if it's a skill issue
3. If it's a fit issue, helps you find a different team that suits you better
4. Only in extreme cases (fraud, harm to others) are you fully removed

**You still get your AUBI**: Even if no team wants to work with you, you still have your baseline income. You just won't earn bonus Hearts.

### **"What stops rich people from gaming the system?"**

Several mechanisms:

1. **Community validation**: Hearts aren't awarded by algorithm alone. Community Weavers (real people who know the community) validate contributions. Hard to fake helping your neighbor when your neighbor is the one validating.

2. **Web of Trust**: To join a community, existing members vouch for you. If you turn out to be gaming the system, they lose reputation. This creates "skin in the game."

3. **Contribution caps**: If you're in the top income bracket, you need to contribute *more* to earn the same Hearts bonus. The system adjusts to prevent exploitation.

4. **Transparent tracking**: All Hearts transactions are public (though privacy-protected). Suspicious patterns get flagged.

5. **The Love Ledger can't be bought**: You can't pay someone to give you Gratitude Tokens. They're tied to genuine relationships and validated by the network.

## Real-World Scenarios

Let's make this concrete with three different people's stories:

### **Scenario 1: Maria, Single Parent**

**Before AUBI**:
- Works 50 hours/week at two part-time jobs (no benefits)
- Still struggles to pay rent
- Exhausted, stressed, no time with her kids
- Can't afford to quit one job to go back to school

**With AUBI**:
- Gets 8,400 SEK baseline each month
- Quits the night shift job (was making 6,000 SEK anyway)
- Joins a childcare co-op part-time (15 hours/week), earns 600 Hearts/month
- Uses those Hearts to pay for tutoring for her kids
- Has time to take an online course
- Mental health improves, kids are happier
- After 18 months, starts teaching her new skill, earns more Hearts

**What changed**: The safety net let her stop running on a treadmill and actually improve her situation.

### **Scenario 2: Erik, Burned-Out Professional**

**Before AUBI**:
- Corporate consultant, 80-hour weeks, well-paid but miserable
- Wanted to do environmental work but "couldn't afford the pay cut"
- Relationship suffering, health declining
- Felt trapped

**With AUBI**:
- Realizes AUBI covers his essential expenses
- Quits consulting job
- Joins wetland restoration team (30 hours/week)
- Earns Hearts + Leaves + reduced stress
- Takes 10 hours/week teaching corporate sustainability (his specialty) for extra Hearts
- Income is less than before, but:
  - He's healthier
  - Relationship improved
  - Feels purposeful
  - Building real ecological value

**What changed**: The system valued work he was passionate about, making the "pay cut" actually viable.

### **Scenario 3: Astrid, Retired Teacher**

**Before AUBI**:
- Living on pension (adequate but tight)
- Felt useless after retirement
- Wanted to help but couldn't afford to volunteer full-time
- Skills going to waste

**With AUBI**:
- Gets 8,400 SEK + 360 Hearts (everyone gets AUBI, even retirees)
- Starts tutoring struggling students (10 hours/week)
- Earns 500 Hearts/month
- Uses Hearts to pay for:
  - Community garden membership
  - Weekly prepared meals from community kitchen
  - Occasional help with house maintenance
- Feels valued, connected, purposeful
- Her Love Ledger score is high (lots of gratitude from students and parents)

**What changed**: Recognition that retired doesn't mean useless. Her skills and care still matter.

## How to Think About This

**AUBI** = Your safety net. You can afford to live.

**Hearts** = Your community's way of saying "thank you" for care work the market ignores.

**Leaves** = The planet's way of saying "thank you" for healing what was damaged.

**Work in Liberation** = Organizing work around meaning, not just money.

**Love Ledger** = Preserving genuine human connection from becoming transactional.

Together, they create a system where:
- You're safe even if you lose your job
- Helping others is recognized as valuable
- Restoring nature actually pays
- Work serves life, not the other way around
- Communities have economic resilience even during crises

## What's the Catch?

**There isn't one, but there are challenges**:

1. **Getting started is hard**: Requires political will, community buy-in, and initial funding.

2. **It's different**: People are used to "work or starve." This requires trusting a new system.

3. **Not perfect from day 1**: Early versions will have bugs, adjustments needed. Community feedback essential.

4. **Requires participation**: This only works if enough people use Hearts, validate each other's work, and engage honestly.

5. **Cultural shift needed**: From "I got mine" to "we all thrive together." Not everyone is ready for that.

But compared to the current system (where care work is invisible, nature is destroyed for profit, and financial crises destroy lives), these challenges seem manageable.

## How to Get Involved

**If your community wants to try this**:

1. **Learn more**: Read the full frameworks at globalgovernanceframeworks.org
2. **Find 10 committed people**: Start a "convening circle" to explore the idea
3. **Contact the team**: globalgovernanceframeworks@gmail.com
4. **Consider a pilot**: Start small (100-1,000 people) and learn

**If you just want to follow along**:
- Watch for pilots in Stockholm (2026) and other locations
- Spread the word about the concept
- Imagine what it could mean for your community

---

## The Bottom Line

**Current system**:
- Work to survive, even if the work is meaningless or harmful
- Care work invisible and unpaid
- Nature destroyed because restoration doesn't make profit
- Financial crises destroy lives randomly
- Communities fragmented and powerless

**Hearts/AUBI system**:
- Baseline security, then choose meaningful work
- Care work recognized and compensated
- Nature restoration pays and is tracked
- Communities have economic resilience
- Local power and connection restored

**It's not utopia**. It's just a system designed to serve humans and the planet, rather than profit and extraction.

**The question isn't "Can we afford to try this?"**

**The question is: "Can we afford to keep doing what we're doing?"**

*This guide was written in December 2025. The first pilot is planned for Stockholm in 2026. If you're reading this and thinking "this makes sense but seems impossible," remember: Every system we take for granted today (weekends, minimum wage, social security) seemed impossible until people built it.*

*The future is built by people who refuse to accept the present as inevitable.*
