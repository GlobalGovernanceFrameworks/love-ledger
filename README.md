# Love Ledger üíö

Welcome to the Love Ledger project\!

## What is Love Ledger?

Love Ledger is a community-driven platform for recognizing, tracking, and rewarding care, ecological stewardship, and meaningful contributions to our communities. It serves as the technical foundation for the **Hearts** (üíö) and **Leaves** (üçÉ) currency systems described in the [Global Governance Frameworks](https://globalgovernanceframeworks.org).

### Core Concepts

  - **Hearts** (üíö): Recognition for care work, community support, cultural preservation, and social contributions.
  - **Leaves** (üçÉ): Recognition for ecological restoration, environmental stewardship, and planetary health activities.
  - **Love Ledger**: The distributed system that tracks and validates these contributions while protecting community autonomy.

## Framework Integration

This project implements key components from several interconnected frameworks:

  - **[Work in Liberation Framework](https://globalgovernanceframeworks.org/frameworks/work-in-liberation)** - Organizing meaningful work and Community Work Teams.
  - **[Financial Systems Framework](https://globalgovernanceframeworks.org/frameworks/financial-systems)** - Hearts/Leaves currency mechanics and the Love Ledger system.
  - **[AUBI Framework](https://globalgovernanceframeworks.org/frameworks/aubi)** - Adaptive Universal Basic Income integration with contribution bonuses.
  - **[Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance](https://globalgovernanceframeworks.org/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge)** - Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs) and traditional stewardship principles.

## Project Status

‚úÖ **MVP Foundation Built, Core Logic Next** ‚úÖ

The foundational infrastructure for the MVP web app is complete as of Sun Jul 27 2025. This includes a full authentication system, a database backend, internationalization, and adaptive theming.

The current focus is on implementing the core economic engine: the functionality for logging care acts and integrating the Hearts and Leaves calculation engine.

## The Web Application

This repository contains the official web application for the Love Ledger. It is a modern, full-stack application built to be accessible, secure, and culturally sensitive.

### Tech Stack

  * **Framework**: SvelteKit 2.x
  * **Language**: TypeScript
  * **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
  * **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with SQLite (local dev) and PostgreSQL (production)
  * **Authentication**: Lucia Auth v3 with Argon2 for password hashing
  * **Validation**: Zod for form and data validation
  * **Testing**: Vitest (Unit/Component) & Playwright (End-to-End)

### Key MVP Features (Roadmap)

The initial version of the web app will focus on three core user journeys:

1.  **üìù Log Care Acts**: A simple, accessible form for community members to submit their contributions for validation.
2.  **‚úÖ Community Validation**: A secure interface for designated Community Weavers to review and validate submissions based on community-defined protocols.
3.  **üìä User Dashboard**: A personal dashboard for users to track their üíö **Hearts** and üçÉ **Leaves** balances and view their contribution history.

### ‚úÖ Current Implemented Features

  * **Authentication System**: Complete user registration, login, and session management with protected routes.
  * **Database & Backend**: SQLite database is set up with Drizzle ORM, including user schemas and a query abstraction layer.
  * **Internationalization (i18n)**: A custom, route-based i18n system supporting English and Swedish is operational.
  * **Adaptive Theming System**: Dual themes ('Living Earth' and 'Cosmic Night') with persistence and accessibility support are implemented.
  * **UI Foundation**: The responsive SvelteKit app includes a dashboard mockup with placeholder components for Hearts/Leaves balances and care act cards.

## üöÄ Getting Started (Local Development)

Interested in running the app locally or contributing? Follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites:**

      * Node.js (v18 or higher)
      * npm

2.  **Installation:**
